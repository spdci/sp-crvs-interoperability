# About the Digital Convergence Initiative (DCI)

- A joint effort by USP2030 members, governments, development partners, civil society and the private sector aimed at creating integrated and interoperable social protection information systems.
- An open, transparent and virtual community working to build a global consensus around standards and guidelines for social protection information systems.

## The challenge:

Even though social protection programmes follow a common set of processes, fragmented social protection information systems are often unable to communicate with other programmes or wider government systems.

This lack of harmonisation and interoperability not only impacts on social protection outcomes, but can also lead to a
waste of public expenditure.

## The aim of the Digital Convergence Initiative:

Reaching consensus on standards and guidelines for interoperability and thus

- Foster an ecosystem for innovation in which technology solution providers can build products that are interoperable.
- Reduce the time and cost of developing solutions.
- Design systems that are prepared for future demands, beyond the current level of maturity of policy and information systems.
- Enable programmes to mix and match interoperable components from various vendors.

## Why you should participate:

If you are implementing social protection programmes, ensuring contextual factors are reflected could ensure that low-cost, future-ready digital solutions arising from global standards and guidelines meet your needs.

If you are a technology solution provider, these standards and guidelines could drive down the cost of accessing new markets. Ultimately, you will be able to shape this consensus-driven process, so that it is able to serve your needs at scale â€“ across countries, programmes and target groups.

## How you can contribute:

True convergence needs meaningful collaboration and dialogue among diverse stakeholders.

Therefore, the initiative is centred around different working groups that will define standards and consolidate work done across institutions and countries. 4 working groups are currently active: (i) principles, (ii) process standards, (iii) data standards and (iv) technical standards.

You can participate by:
- Sharing existing materials.
- Reviewing the outputs
- Joining focus group discussions
- Drafting standards and guidelines

If you have suggestions for future expansions, or think you have found a bug in our code, feel free to **open a new issue** in this repository.
You can also use the **labels**, e.g. for the respective working groups to make it easier to identify what you and the community is working on and where you would like to contribute.
We are always happy to engage with our community.
