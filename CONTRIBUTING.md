# We welcome contributions

As an initiative aiming to achieve interoperability, we are always eager to cooperate and to facilitate joint forces.

## Why you should participate:

If you are implementing social protection programmes, ensuring contextual factors are reflected could ensure that low-cost, future-ready digital solutions arising from global standards and guidelines meet your needs.

If you are a technology solution provider, these standards and guidelines could drive down the cost of accessing new markets. Ultimately, you will be able to shape this consensus-driven process, so that it is able to serve your needs at scale â€“ across countries, programmes and target groups.

## How you can contribute:

True convergence needs meaningful collaboration and dialogue among diverse stakeholders.

Therefore, the initiative is centred around different working groups that will define standards and consolidate work done across institutions and countries. 4 working groups are currently active: (i) principles, (ii) process standards, (iii) data standards and (iv) technical standards.

You can participate by:
- Sharing existing materials.
- Reviewing the outputs
- Joining focus group discussions
- Drafting standards and guidelines

If you have suggestions for future expansions, or think you have found a bug in our code, feel free to **open a new issue** in this repository.
You can also use the **labels**, e.g. for the respective working groups to make it easier to identify what you and the community is working on and where you would like to contribute.
We are always happy to engage with our community.
